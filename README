Purpose:

This is an open source logic optimizer for 7400 series chips.
Many algorithms (Espresso, Quine-McClusky, K-maps, etc) exist
minimize digital logic for sum of products (SoP) or product 
of sums (PoS) configurations but not for situations where:
	- Gates don't exist with more than 4 inputs
	- Other gates (like XOR) can be used to reduce the 
	  number of gates used.
	- Gates come in packs rather than individaully. While
	  with manufacturing silicon each additional gate
	  consumes resources, with 7400 series logic, once
	  one gate is used, the rest that share the IC package
	  are essentially "free"

Project Layout and Algorithm:
todo: type this

Platforms:
-Mac(untested) or Linux
-Shouldn't be too hard to get it to work on windows
-Should work on 32 bit but this is also untested

Dependencies:
-Octothorpe (included as git submodule)

Bugs: 
-Probably lots
